# employeeDataTask

a very simple task to help us learn how to fetch data from an API
we used json placeholder to get the endpoint API
we used HTTP for API call
it requires a dependecy and some imports
we parse the json responses in the employee_service then we map them to an employee_model

for the UI we just made an ElevatedButton to go to EmployeeData page to fetch the data

#project is pushed to master branch
